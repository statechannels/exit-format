**Standard Exit Format for L2s built on EVM chains**

We present a general standard for such a format, along with coders written in Typescript, which will aid L2 interoperability and support arbitrary tokens.

Description

The idea behind this library is to standardise the data structures used in exiting a layer 2 system: whether that is a [Celer](https://www.celer.network/), [Connext](https://connext.network/), or [Nitro](https://statechannels.org/) state channel or a rollup such as [Arbitrum](https://offchainlabs.com/) or [Optimism](https://optimism.io/). An exit format allows one to specify how assets locked up and redistributed in an L2 should be paid out in L1. Standard utilities, built against a standard format, can undergo a higher concentration of scrutiny from the community and auditors â€” a major benefit.

We hope to receive feedback from as many layer 2 projects as possible, to help towards writing a standards track EIP. Adoption of this standard improves interoperability between L2s, and enables the sharing of L2 entrance & exit utilities, such as exit meta transactions.

We have concentrated so far on a format that works for [Nitro state channels](https://medium.com/magmo/nitro-protocol-c49b50f59df7). The new format enables us to streamline our virtual channel construction, simplifying the protocol while lowering the gas costs for channel disputes.

The standard is extensible enough to support future token standards and even to describe cross-chain assets.

### How It's Made

The main content is the definition of an exit format, with some exit-transformations implemented in Typescript and Solidity.

This repo depends on `ethers-js` for ABI encoding.
